---- concept:

why we shall not add a const/let/function vars/objs in a dependency array of useEffect or something else?
cuz on every re-render the reference [mem location] of the variavle will change, [redefined in each render]
and as the reference changes useEffect will run the code inside it again, if that results in a re-render [which happens most of the time] then it variable will be redefined again and thus creating an infinite loop.

use useState or useMemo if it needs to be added in a dependency

npx cap sync android or npx cap copy android

npx cap open android

to do: recently visited genre quick link in homw page
add somg -> radio btn, multiple files at once


why do i need to expand the objects in useState? arn't they already structred like an object? so no ref change
