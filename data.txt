repeat fix,
context fix, else index is coming same
return 0 for playNext = true

on page chnage the intented effects doesnot seem to work, i have to reload
current audio not changing on page change


  // fetch them -- no need, cuz as of now they should be fixed bcz of music-page-data, just songs inside will vary
            dropdownItems: [

Frequent loading means its re-rendering and refetching -- to be fixed

in mobiles audio is stopping automatically

---- concept:

why we shall not add a const/let/function vars/objs in a dependency array of useEffect or something else?
cuz on every re-render the reference [mem location] of the variavle will change, [redefined in each render]
and as the reference changes useEffect will run the code inside it again, if that results in a re-render [which happens most of the time] then it variable will be redefined again and thus creating an infinite loop.

use useState or useMemo if it needs to be added in a dependency
